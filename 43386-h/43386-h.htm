</div>
</div>

<p>and the aim of the publishers of the Globe Library has
been to make it possible for the universal kin of English-speaking
men to hold communion with the loftiest "spirits
of the mighty dead;" to put within the reach of all classes
<i>complete</i> and <i>accurate</i> editions, carefully and clearly printed
upon the best paper, in a convenient form, at a moderate
price, of the works of the <span class="smcap">master-minds of English
Literature</span>, and occasionally of foreign literature in an
attractive English dress.</p>

<p>The Editors, by their scholarship and special study of
their authors, are competent to afford every assistance to
readers of all kinds: this assistance is rendered by original
biographies, glossaries of unusual or obsolete words, and
critical and explanatory notes.</p>

<p>The publishers hope, therefore, that these Globe Editions
may prove worthy of acceptance by all classes wherever the
English Language is spoken, and by their universal circulation
justify their distinctive epithet; while at the same time
they spread and nourish a common sympathy with nature's
most "finely touched" spirits, and thus help a little to
"make the whole world kin."</p>
