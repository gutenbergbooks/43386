      particular character is shown are set forth with rare
      dramatic power. For excellence that will endure, we incline
      to place this very near the top of the list of Christmas
      books._" _And the_ ART JOURNAL _observes_,

MACMILLAN'S GLOBE LIBRARY.

      _Beautifully printed on toned paper and bound in cloth
      extra, gilt edges, price 4s. 6d. each; in cloth plain, 3s.
      6d. Also kept in a variety of calf and morocco bindings at
      moderate prices._


BOOKS, Wordsworth says, are

             "the spirit breathed
     By dead men to their kind;"

and the aim of the publishers of the Globe Library has been to make
it possible for the universal kin of English-speaking men to hold
communion with the loftiest "spirits of the mighty dead;" to put
within the reach of all classes _complete_ and _accurate_ editions,
carefully and clearly printed upon the best paper, in a convenient
form, at a moderate price, of the works of the MASTER-MINDS OF
ENGLISH LITERATURE, and occasionally of foreign literature in an
attractive English dress.

The Editors, by their scholarship and special study of their authors,
are competent to afford every assistance to readers of all kinds: this
assistance is rendered by original biographies, glossaries of unusual
or obsolete words, and critical and explanatory notes.

The publishers hope, therefore, that these Globe Editions may prove
worthy of acceptance by all classes wherever the English Language is
spoken, and by their universal circulation justify their distinctive
epithet; while at the same time they spread and nourish a common
sympathy with nature's most "finely touched" spirits, and thus help a
little to "make the whole world kin."

      _The_ SATURDAY REVIEW _says_: "_The Globe Editions are
      admirable for their scholarly editing, their typographical
      excellence, their compendious form, and their cheapness._"
      _The_ BRITISH QUARTERLY REVIEW _says_: "_In compendiousness,
      elegance, and scholarliness, the Globe Editions of Messrs.
      Macmillan surpass any popular series of our classics
      hitherto given to the public. As near an approach to
      miniature perfection as has ever been made._"

=Shakespeare's Complete Works.= Edited by W. G. CLARK, M.A., and
W. ALDIS WRIGHT, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, Editors of the

      _The_ ATHENÆUM _says this edition is_ "_a marvel of beauty,
      cheapness, and compactness.... For the busy man, above all
      for the working student, this is the best of all existing
      Shakespeares._" _And the_ PALL MALL GAZETTE _observes_:
      "_To have produced the complete works of the world's
      greatest poet in such a form, and at a price within the
      reach of every one, is of itself almost sufficient to give
      the publishers a claim to be considered public benefactors._"

      _The_ LITERARY CHURCHMAN _remarks_: "_The editor's

      "_Mr. Benham's edition of Cowper is one of permanent
      value. The biographical introduction is excellent,
      full of information, singularly neat and readable and
      modest--indeed too modest in its comments. The notes
      are concise and accurate, and the editor has been able
      to discover and introduce some hitherto unprinted
      matter. Altogether the book is a very excellent
      one._"--SATURDAY REVIEW.

      non-classical readers it will be invaluable as a faithful

      highest value in the way of criticism, illustration, and
